## About
Hi, I’m Patricia, a passionate and detail-oriented Data Analyst with 6 of experience in transforming data into actionable insights. My expertise spans across data visualization, statistical analysis, and leveraging tools like Python, SQL, Tableau, and Power BI to solve complex business problems.

I thrive on uncovering patterns and trends in data to drive informed decision-making. Whether it’s building interactive dashboards, creating predictive models, or performing in-depth campaign analysis, I enjoy bringing clarity to data and making an impact.

**Key Skills:**
- Data Analysis & Visualization: Proficient in creating dashboards and reports using Tableau, Power BI, and Excel.
- Programming: Experienced in Python (pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn) and SQL for data manipulation and analysis.
- Statistical Analysis: Skilled in hypothesis testing, regression analysis, and A/B testing.
- Business Insights: Adept at translating data findings into actionable recommendations to optimize marketing and operational strategies.

## Portfolio Projects
In this section, I will showcase data analytics projects, providing a brief overview of the technology stack used to address each case.

### Mean Variance Standard Deviation Calculator
**Code:** [mean_var_std.py](https://github.com/Prockentine/mean-variance-standard-deviation-calculator/blob/main/mean_var_std.py)

**Description:** Developed a Python-based calculator to compute descriptive statistics such as mean, variance, standard deviation, maximum, minimum, and sum for a 3x3 matrix using Numpy. The program accepts a list of 9 numbers, transforms it into a 3x3 Numpy array, and outputs a structured dictionary containing the computed statistics for rows, columns, and the entire matrix. Included error handling ensures the input meets the required format.

**Skills:** Created a NumPy array to transform a list to a matrix, performed axis-specific computations for descriptive statistics, applied NumPy aggregation functions to calculate matrix-level and axis-level statistics, & debugged and validated outputs using unit tests.

**Technology:** Python, NumPy, JupyterLab, Git

### Demographic Data Analyzer
**Code:** [demographic_data_analyzer.py](https://github.com/Prockentine/demographic-data-anayzer/blob/main/demographic_data_analyzer.py)

**Description:** Analyze demographic data using Pandas for data manipulation and analysis. The dataset, extracted from the 1994 Census database, contains various demographic attributes such as age, workclass, education, occupation, and salary. Your goal is to answer a series of demographic and salary-related questions by performing calculations and operations on the data.

**Skills:** Grouped and aggregated data, performed mathematical and statistical operations, manipulated DataFrames and Series, & debugged and validated outputs using unit tests.

**Technology:** Python, Pandas, JupyterLab, Git
